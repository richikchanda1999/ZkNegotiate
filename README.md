### **Project Name: Autonomous Privacy-Preserving Negotiation Agent**

---

### **Description:**
An **AI negotiation agent** that enables two or more parties to negotiate deals or agreements while keeping their preferences, constraints, and sensitive data private. **Walrus** is used to store encrypted negotiation parameters, and **Sp1 zkVM** ensures that the negotiation process adheres to predefined rules, with verifiable integrity.

---

### **How It Works:**

1. **Negotiation Data Storage:**
   - Each party uploads their preferences, constraints, and negotiation conditions (e.g., budget, deadlines) encrypted to Walrus.
   - The data remains private and accessible only to the negotiation agent.

2. **Autonomous Negotiation:**
   - The agent fetches the encrypted data from Walrus.
   - Using Sp1 zkVM, the agent performs negotiations while:
     - Ensuring computations are correct (e.g., matching offers within constraints).
     - Generating zk-proofs that all rules and constraints were followed.

3. **Verifiable Outputs:**
   - The negotiation result (e.g., agreed price, terms, or conditions) is shared with all parties, accompanied by zk-proofs ensuring:
     - No sensitive data was exposed.
     - The agent adhered to all constraints and rules.

4. **Smart Contract Execution:**
   - The finalized deal can trigger smart contract execution (e.g., transferring funds, initiating a service) based on the agreed terms.

### **Use Cases:**

1. **Business-to-Business (B2B) Deals:**
   - Companies can negotiate contracts, pricing, or partnerships without revealing sensitive internal data (e.g., budgets, production costs).

2. **DAO Governance:**
   - DAOs can negotiate funding, mergers, or voting terms while keeping internal proposals private.

3. **eCommerce Auctions:**
   - Buyers and sellers can negotiate prices while keeping their maximum offers or reserves private.

4. **Legal Settlements:**
   - Lawyers can use the agent to mediate settlements without exposing their clients' sensitive legal or financial information.

### **Features:**

1. **Privacy:**
   - Encrypted negotiation parameters are stored on Walrus.
   - Sp1 zkVM ensures negotiation logic adheres to rules without revealing sensitive data.

2. **Trust and Verifiability:**
   - zk-proofs validate that the negotiation process was fair and compliant with agreed-upon rules.

3. **Automation:**
   - The agent autonomously conducts negotiations, saving time and effort for participants.

4. **Smart Contract Integration:**
   - Finalized agreements can trigger actions like payments or contract execution.

### **Technical Stack:**

1. **Frontend:**
   - **Next.js App:** Interface for users to define negotiation parameters and view results.

2. **Backend:**
   - **Walrus SDK:** For encrypted storage of negotiation inputs.
   - **Sp1 zkVM:** For private and verifiable computation of negotiation logic.

3. **Smart Contracts:**
   - Handle deal finalization, fund transfers, or service initiation.
